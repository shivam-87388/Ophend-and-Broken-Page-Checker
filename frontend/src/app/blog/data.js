        description: `An orphan page is a webpage that exists on your website but has no internal links pointing to it. In other words, no other page on your website connects to it, making it difficult for both users and search engines to find.

Orphan pages are often overlooked because they are technically live but invisible within the website structure. Without links from other pages or menus, these pages may remain unindexed or get very low visibility in search results.

Common Causes of Orphan Pages

Pages created during website redesign without adding internal links

Old blog posts or content removed from menus

Landing pages for marketing campaigns

Improper internal linking strategies

Content left in the website but not connected

Why Orphan Pages Are Bad for SEO

Orphan pages can harm your website in several ways:

1. Poor Crawlability: Search engines rely on links to discover pages. Orphan pages may remain undiscovered.

2. No Link Equity: Internal links pass SEO value. Orphan pages get no authority, making them difficult to rank.

3. Wasted Content Effort: You may have invested in content creation, but if the page is orphaned, it provides little SEO value.

4. Indexing Issues: Orphan pages may never appear in search engine results, wasting potential traffic.`

CMS errors or plugin conflicts happen

Broken pages affect user experience, SEO performance, and the credibility of your website.

SEO Impact of Broken Pages

Destroy backlink value if links point to broken URLs

While fixing them is important, preventing them in the first place is even more effective. Following best practices helps maintain a clean site structure, improves crawlability, and protects search engine rankings.

Maintain a Strong Internal Linking Structure

Every important page on a website should be connected through internal links. Linking related pages within content, menus, and footers ensures that search engines and users can easily discover all pages.

Avoid Deleting Pages Without Redirects

When a page is removed or its URL is changed, a proper 301 redirect should always be implemented. This prevents broken pages and preserves SEO value from backlinks and internal links.

Perform Regular Website Audits

Regular technical SEO audits help identify orphan pages and broken links early. Monitoring website health ensures that small issues do not turn into major SEO problems.

Keep Website Structure Organized

A clear site hierarchy with logical categories and subcategories reduces the chances of pages becoming orphaned. Organized structure improves both navigation and crawlability.

Monitor Changes After Updates or Migrations

Website redesigns and migrations often create orphan and broken pages. Reviewing links and redirects after updates helps prevent long-term SEO damage.`

Both issues confuse search engines, reduce crawl efficiency, and harm user experience.
In this blog, we will understand how to identify and fix orphan pages and broken pages effectively.

What Are Orphan Pages?

Orphan pages are live pages on a website that are not linked from any other internal page. Since search engines discover pages mainly through links, orphan pages often remain unindexed or receive very low traffic.

Why Orphan Pages Are Harmful

Search engines may not find or index them

Users cannot navigate to them easily

SEO value is wasted

Important content may be ignored

How to Fix Orphan Pages
1. Add Internal Links

The best way to fix orphan pages is by linking them from relevant pages. Add links within blog content, category pages, navigation menus, or footer sections.

2. Include Pages in Site Structure

Make sure every important page belongs to a proper category or hierarchy. A clear site structure helps prevent pages from becoming orphaned.

3. Update XML Sitemap

Ensure orphan pages are added to the XML sitemap so search engines can discover them more easily.

4. Remove Low-Value Pages

If an orphan page has no SEO or business value, it’s better to delete it and redirect it properly instead of keeping it live.

What Are Broken Pages?

Broken pages occur when a URL no longer exists or has been moved without proper redirection. These pages usually show a 404 Not Found error.

Why Broken Pages Are Harmful

Poor user experience

Loss of link equity

Negative SEO signals

Increased bounce rate

How to Fix Broken Pages
1. Set Up 301 Redirects

If a page has been deleted or its URL has changed, use a 301 redirect to send users and search engines to the most relevant alternative page.

2. Fix Incorrect Internal Links

Update internal links that are pointing to non-existent URLs. This prevents users from landing on error pages.

3. Restore Important Pages

If a broken page was important and had backlinks or traffic, consider restoring the page with updated content.

4. Use Custom 404 Page

A user-friendly 404 page helps guide visitors to other useful sections of the website instead of letting them leave.

Tools to Find Orphan and Broken Pages

Google Search Console

Screaming Frog SEO Spider

Ahrefs or SEMrush

Website audit tools

These tools help identify pages with no internal links and URLs returning 404 errors.`
