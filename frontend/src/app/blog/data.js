        description: `An orphan page is a webpage that exists on your website but has no internal links pointing to it. In other words, no other page on your website connects to it, making it difficult for both users and search engines to find.

Orphan pages are often overlooked because they are technically live but invisible within the website structure. Without links from other pages or menus, these pages may remain unindexed or get very low visibility in search results.

Common Causes of Orphan Pages

Pages created during website redesign without adding internal links

Old blog posts or content removed from menus

Landing pages for marketing campaigns

Improper internal linking strategies

Content left in the website but not connected

Why Orphan Pages Are Bad for SEO

Orphan pages can harm your website in several ways:

1. Poor Crawlability: Search engines rely on links to discover pages. Orphan pages may remain undiscovered.

2. No Link Equity: Internal links pass SEO value. Orphan pages get no authority, making them difficult to rank.

3. Wasted Content Effort: You may have invested in content creation, but if the page is orphaned, it provides little SEO value.

4. Indexing Issues: Orphan pages may never appear in search engine results, wasting potential traffic.`

        shortDesc:"A broken page, also known as a 404 error page, is a webpage that cannot be accessed because the URL is incorrect, the page has been deleted, or there is a server issue. When users or search engines try to visit a broken page, they receive an error message indicating that the page is not found.",

        description: `Broken pages are web pages that fail to load correctly or return error codes like 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, or 503 Service Unavailable.

They often appear when:

URLs are deleted or changed

Internal or external links are broken

Server or hosting issues occur

CMS errors or plugin conflicts happen

Broken pages affect user experience, SEO performance, and the credibility of your website.

SEO Impact of Broken Pages

Broken pages can:

Increase bounce rate because users leave immediately

Waste crawl budget, preventing search engines from indexing important pages

Destroy backlink value if links point to broken URLs

Reduce overall search engine rankings`
